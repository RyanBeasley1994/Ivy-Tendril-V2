 *

 *
 * | effect | embedded |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `store.subscribe` / `store.init()` | **kept** — it is the conversation. The panel's store is its own, so `init()` opens a second `chat-event` listener; unmount `destroy()`s it, so a visit leaks nothing. |
 * | `store.pruneEmptySessions()` on unmount | **off**. V1 prunes in `ChatApp`, not in `ContentView`, and an embedded prune would reach chats the panel does not own. |
 * | `usePublishSidebarList` | **off**, and the list is not even built. `PlanChatView` publishes none, which is exactly why V1's embedded chat shows no session list. |
 * | `useWebviewFileDrop` | **kept** (scoped to container). In both standalone and embedded mode, it listens on the webview and uses `targetRef` to ensure drops made inside the chat area are accepted while drops elsewhere are ignored. |
 * | `ChatHeader` | **off**: V1 swaps the whole header for a right-aligned `JobsMenu` that appears only once the conversation has jobs. So no rename, no delete menu, and no new-chat button — `PlanChatView` passes `startNewChat: () => { }`. |
 * | composer keys, voice recorder, autoscroll, lightbox, `ResizeObserver` | **kept**: all of them are this instance's own DOM. |
 * | `jobsStore` / `plansStore` subscriptions | **kept**. Read-only, and `PlanChatView` subscribes to `JobsChanged` for the same reason — the jobs pill follows the live list. |
 *
 * There is no keyboard shortcut to gate: the composer's Enter handling is a `keydown` on its own
 * textarea, and every registered `useShortcut` in the app belongs to `App.tsx` or `PlanWorkspace`.
