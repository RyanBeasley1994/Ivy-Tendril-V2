   * Porting a cell-update channel on top of that would be a second source of truth for six cells.

   * What does not arrive on any event is the *passage of time*: Timer counts up from `startedAt` and
   * Agent Output counts up from `lastOutputAt` while nothing about the job changes. So this is V1's
   * one-second interval, narrowed to its cause - it runs only while some row is Running, and stops when
   * none is.
   *
   * It re-renders and nothing more. Both cells are read off a timestamp the daemon already served, so a
   * tick costs one `buildJobRows` over the loaded window and never a refetch - which matters, because
