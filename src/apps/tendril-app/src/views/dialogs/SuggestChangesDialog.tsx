 * view is handed their answers as `allowed` and `inFlightCount`.
 *
 * The dispatch differs by mode. App comments go through `bridge.startJob` directly, bypassing
 * `PlanActionsController.retryPlan`, because that controller's gate is `canRetry` (Review or
 * Failed) while this dialog answers to `CanRequestChanges`, which deliberately also allows a plan
 * already applying a retry. Diff comments go through the controller, and then clear the plan's
 * drafts - V1's `ClearDraftCommentsAsync` - which is deliberately not awaited into the failure
 * path: the job has already started, and a plan whose comments outlived their dispatch is a smaller
 * problem than a dialog reporting failure for a job that ran.
