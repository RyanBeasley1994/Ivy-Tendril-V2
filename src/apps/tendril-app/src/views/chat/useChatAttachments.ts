   * composer uploads every attachment into `<TendrilHome>/Attachments/<sessionId>/` and references the
   * copy. The staged path is also what the turn's `[Attached Files]:` block carries, so the agent reads
   * the same bytes the thumbnail shows.

   * agent is still told about a file that exists and only the thumbnail falls back to a chip.
