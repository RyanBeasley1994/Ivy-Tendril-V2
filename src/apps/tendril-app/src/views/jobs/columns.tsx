 * *lexicographic* one; they agree for every id the daemon issues, because `allocate_job_id`
 * (`jobs/manager.rs:414`) formats them as `{:05}` and equal-width numeric strings sort the same either

 * `ReportedPlanTitle`) and are repeated here only because `resolveRemoteSort` reads a list of names
 * rather than the rendered columns — the fetcher is built before them. Two are genuinely derived:
 *
 * - **Timer** counts up from `StartedAt` for a running job and shows the recorded duration for a
 *   finished one, so `DurationSeconds` is the closest total order the table has. Running rows have no
 *   duration yet, so they group at the `NULL` end rather than interleaving by elapsed time.
 * - **Agent Output** counts up from `LastOutputAt` for a running job, so the column has no total order
 *   of its own: `Status` is what groups the three forms the cell takes (an elapsed silence, `Done`,
 *   `-`). Ordering by `LastOutputAt` instead would be a real order over running rows and meaningless
 *   over every other row, which is the larger part of any job list. V1 cannot express it either — it
 *   sorts the rendered string.
 *
 * Everything else resolves by name: the daemon matches a column case- and underscore-insensitively, so
 * `statusMessage` reaches `StatusMessage`.
