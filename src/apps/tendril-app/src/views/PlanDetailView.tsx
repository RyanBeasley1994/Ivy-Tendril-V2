   * plan whose body genuinely was that sentence looked identical to a plan that had none; and it
   * gave one answer to three different questions, which is how plans 00003 and 00004 came to sit
   * there looking merely empty.
   *
   * Those two are the concrete evidence. Their folders have a `Revisions/` directory with nothing in
   * it, `revisionCount: 0`, and a `plan.yaml` whose `updated` still equals its `created` — their
   * CreatePlan jobs (00010 and 00013) were killed by stop-all between `tendril plan create`, which
   * makes the folder, and `tendril plan write-revision`, which writes `001.md`. Nothing was ever
   * written, nothing failed to load, and the page said neither.
   *
   * So the three cases are named apart:
   *  - `writing`  — a job holds the plan right now, so the body is expected to be absent.
   *  - `never`    — no revision file exists (`revisionCount === 0`). The creating job did not finish.
   *  - `unreadable` — the count says a revision is on disk but its text came back empty, which is a
   *    read fault rather than a plan that was never drafted, and must not be reported as the latter.
