 * "the plan's own session, hosted by the same content view the Chat app uses". V1 builds it by
 * constructing `new Chat.ContentView(...)` with `embedded: true`, and this does the same thing by
 * rendering {@link ChatView} with `embedded`.
 *
 * That is the whole point of the component. Everything the main chat has — the eventwire tool-call
 * stream and its cards, the Antigravity parser, the queue with its edit and send-now, the pinned
 * question and the jump-to-question control, the attachment chips, the confirm dialog, the composer's
 * one-line-to-toolbar layout, the spawned-job pill — is here because it is the same view, not because
 * it was ported twice.
 *
 * The four things V1 passes it, and they are the only four:
 * - a session/agent/model/effort state of its own → a plan-scoped {@link ChatStore},
 * - `greeting: $"#{plan.Id} {plan.Title}"` and `headline: PlanChatView.Headline`,
 * - `samplePrompts: SamplePrompts.ForPlan(plan)`,
 * - `startNewChat: () => { }`, a no-op — which `embedded` renders as no new-chat affordance at all.
 *
 * V1 additionally renders `isShareMode ? null : new PlanChatView(...)`. V2 has no share mode yet
 * (nothing in the app reads an `isShareMode`), so there is no arm to preserve; when one arrives, it
 * belongs at the two call sites, exactly as V1 puts it there.

   * turn in one is never written into the other.
   *
   * One store per plan, so switching plans builds a new one rather than re-pointing this one. The
   * scope it reads is refined in place rather than rebuilt: the review page renders this panel from a
   * queue row and only learns the plan's `folderPath` when the detail record lands a moment later.
   * Rebuilding the store then would tear a conversation down and put another in its place; taking the
   * folder on in place instead leaves the panel alone and simply widens what a *new* session records.
