/**
 * The navigation seam: **one** `navigate({ appId, args, tabId })` plus a read of the current address.
 *
 * It matches the behaviour of V1's `AppShell/AppShellRouter.cs` without porting its shape. V1 returns
 * an action enum from a hand-written switch because that is what its shell needed; the same four
 * decisions are expressed here as URL state, which is what this stack expects:
 *
 * 1. **An address naming a session pane restores that pane.** Found → it comes to the front. Not
 *    found *and* the address was reached by history (back/forward) → an error, because silently
 *    opening something else would rewrite the user's history under them. This is V1's `TabId` rule,
 *    and it needs no `HistoryOp` of its own: `popstate` *is* the pop.
 * 2. **An address naming no app does nothing.**
 * 3. **An `allowDuplicateTabs` app opens as a session pane, keyed by its session id**, so reopening
 *    the same session reveals the pane already running it instead of spawning a second agent.
 * 4. **Everything else is the one page in the content frame.** A page is never a tab.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* a router: no route matching, no route tree, no history stack of its own
 * (the browser's is the only one). TanStack Router is the intended implementation and is not
 * installed - the registry is unreachable from the dev sandbox - so adopting it is a change behind
 * this seam rather than a rewrite of every caller. What it would have to change:
 *
 * - `parseAddress` / `addressToUrl` become a route tree with `plans`, `plan/$planId`, `job/$jobId`
 *   and friends, and validated `search` schemas in place of {@link Address.args}.
 * - `navigate` becomes the router's own `navigate`, and rules 3 and 4 become which route a target
 *   matches rather than a branch here.
 * - {@link useNavigation} becomes the router's location hooks, and this module's subscription and
 *   `popstate` listener go with it.
 * - {@link SessionPane} stays: it is the shell's own pane registry, not routing state. Only its
 *   *active* member is addressable, which is V1's arrangement too.

   * V1 spells the same decision inside the widget tree: the host pads every app by 16px
   * (`AppHostWidget.tsx`: `p-4`) and an app opts out by putting `RemoveParentPadding()` on its root
   * layout, which the `:has(> .remove-parent-padding)` rules in the framework's `index.css` turn into
   * `padding: 0 !important` on the *parent*. It is all-or-nothing there, and all-or-nothing here.
   *
   * V2 has no widget tree and no `AppHostWidget`, so the equivalent has to be declared where the
   * shell can read it before it renders the page - which is here, beside the other two facts the
   * shell needs about an app. Keeping it in the registry rather than on each view's root `<div>` is
   * the point: one default, one explicit opt-out list, and {@link isFullBleedApp} as the single
   * question the shell asks. Scattered `p-*` classes on view roots are what made the padding
   * inconsistent in the first place.
   *
   * Note that several components ported from V1 still carry the literal `remove-parent-padding`
   * class on their root - `TendrilShell`, `PlanWorkspace`, `TendrilDashboard`, `WebViewer` - and
   * **it does nothing in V2**: no stylesheet here implements the `:has()` rules that give it meaning
   * in the framework. That inert class is why the drift went unnoticed; those components declared
   * themselves full-bleed and nothing was listening. This flag is what listens now.
   *
   * The set is V1's, verified against `Ivy-Tendril/src/Ivy.Tendril/Apps`. Chat, Plans (list and
   * detail), Review, ReviewAction and Agent say so with `RemoveParentPadding()`. Dashboard and
   * Settings say so implicitly, because the root widget each returns already carries the class
   * (`TendrilDashboard`'s `.tdb-root`, and `SidebarLayoutWidget` for `new SidebarLayout(...)`), and
   * each then re-applies an inset of its own inside. Jobs, Inbox, Recommendations, Pull Requests and
   * Icebox sit inside the 16px default - see the test in `tests/shell-content-padding.test.tsx` for
   * why V1's `HeaderLayout`/`FooterLayout` opt-outs do not change that.
