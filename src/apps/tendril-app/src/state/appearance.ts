 * shell reads all three back **per client session**: `TendrilAppShell` seeds the sidebar from
 * `SidebarOpen`, and `TendrilThemes.ApplyTheme` / `ApplyThemeMode` install the preset and the
 * light/dark mode. That is why this module exists at all: without a start-up read, the settings pane
 * would only be applying them to the session that changed them, and a restart would show whatever
 * `localStorage` last held instead of what is on disk.
 *
 * `sidebarOpen` is deliberately not applied here - `uiStore.init` owns it, because the collapsed flag
 * is its state and the value is a *default for a new session* rather than live state.
