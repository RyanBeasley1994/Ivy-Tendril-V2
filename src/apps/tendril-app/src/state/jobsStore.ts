   * `/api/jobs/:id/events` is bearer-authenticated and the webview has no secret to send. `baseUrl`
   * and `token` describe the HTTP transport used in a browser build; the session view passes neither,
   * which used to mean sending no `Authorization` header at all, so every job subscription the desktop
   * app made was answered with a 401 and the session view never showed live output.
   *
   * A resubscription resumes from the last line this store ingested, so a remount does not replay the
   * run it already has.
