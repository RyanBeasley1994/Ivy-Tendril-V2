             it no longer belongs to: the badge counts one fewer than the rows beneath it, and
             clicking the stale row lands on an unrelated plan through `resolvePlanSelection`'s
             bounce-to-newest. Dropping the row is all of `advanceWithinQueue` that applies here —
             the navigation half is exactly what must not happen.

             Only from a Review list, and read from the published list rather than from
             `detail.state`. Reset is offered on Blocked as well (`PlanActionsController.canReset`),
             and Blocked and Draft are both Plans-queue states, so that plan keeps its row and
