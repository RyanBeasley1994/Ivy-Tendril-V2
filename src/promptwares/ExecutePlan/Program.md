# ExecutePlan

**Note:** This promptware is stack-agnostic. Stack-specific operations (build, format, test) are defined as verifications in the project configuration. Examples in this document use multiple tech stacks for illustration.

Purpose: Execute an approved plan in isolated git worktrees.

## Context

The firmware header contains:

- **TendrilPlanFolder** — path to the plan folder
- **CurrentTime** — current UTC timestamp
- **Note** (optional) — Additional instructions from the reviewer. If present, follow these instructions in addition to the plan.

The plan structure and CLI commands are in the **Reference Documents** section of your firmware.
Project repos, verifications, and context are in the **Projects** section of your firmware. Use `tendril verification get <name>` to fetch the full prompt for each verification at execution time.

The launcher sets the working directory to the project's primary repo.

**Mission milestones:** When the firmware header has a **MissionBranch**, this plan is one milestone of a mission. Its base branch (`RepoConfigs`) is that local mission branch, which already holds every earlier milestone — there is no `origin/<MissionBranch>`, so compare against the local branch (`git diff <MissionBranch>...HEAD`, `git log <MissionBranch>..HEAD`). Build on the earlier milestones' work rather than redoing it. Never push and never open a pull request: the mission's orchestrator judges this milestone, lands it on the mission branch, and the whole mission ships as one pull request at the end.

**Note:** Plans are often executed multiple times. For example, a reviewer may not be satisfied with the first execution and sends the plan back to Draft with comments (via UpdatePlan). When re-executing, the worktree branch from the previous run may already exist — handle this gracefully (delete old worktree first, or create with a new branch suffix). Check for existing artifacts and verification reports from prior runs.

**Resume-vs-redo on re-execution:** Before deleting anything, run an integrity check on the prior run. If `plan.yaml` has commits populated and all verifications `Pass`, every `Pass` verification has a report, `Artifacts/summary.md` exists, the worktree is clean with HEAD matching the last recorded commit, and the expected code changes are present in the files — then **resume** (log it and exit successfully) rather than redoing work. Redoing creates new commit hashes and breaks downstream CreatePr references. Only fall back to the full re-execution flow if any of those checks fail.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Read Plan

- Read `plan.yaml` from the plan folder (project, repos, title)
- Read the latest revision: `tendril plan get-revision <TendrilPlanId>`
- Extract the plan ID from the folder name (e.g. `01105` from `01105-TestPlan`)
- Report plan context to Jobs UI: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Reading plan..." --plan-id=<plan-id> --plan-title="<title>"`

### 1.5. Verify Dependencies

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Checking dependencies..."`

If `plan.yaml` has a `dependsOn` list, for each entry:

1. Locate the dependency plan folder in the plans directory
2. Verify the dependency plan's state is `Completed`
3. Verify all PRs listed in the dependency's `plan.yaml` are actually merged on GitHub:

   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr-url> --json state -q .state
   # Must return "MERGED"
   ```

4. If any dependency is unmet (not completed or PRs not merged), **fail immediately** with a clear message explaining which dependency isn't ready and why.

**Note:** The JobService also performs this check before launching ExecutePlan, but this step acts as a safety net in case the dependency state changed between job launch and execution.

### 1.6. Validate Worktree Isolation

Before creating worktrees, verify the execution environment is safe:

1. **Check each repo is not itself a worktree** — If `<repo-path>/.git` is a file containing `gitdir:`, the repo is a worktree. Fail with error:
   > ERROR: Repository at <repo-path> is itself a worktree. ExecutePlan cannot create worktrees inside worktrees. Update project configuration to use the main repo path.

2. **Check Plans directory is not inside a worktree** — If `$TENDRIL_HOME` or its parent contains a worktree `.git` file, fail with error:
   > ERROR: TENDRIL_HOME is inside a git worktree. Move your Tendril installation or change the Plans directory.

```bash
# For each repo in plan.yaml repos (or project repos if empty):
cd <repo-path>

# Check if current directory is a worktree
if [ -f .git ] && grep -q "gitdir:" .git; then
    echo "ERROR: Repository at <repo-path> is itself a worktree."
    echo "ExecutePlan cannot create worktrees inside worktrees."
    echo "Check that project repo paths point to main repositories, not worktrees."
    tendril job fail TendrilJobId --message="Cannot create worktrees: repository at <repo-path> is itself a git worktree. Update the project's repo path to point at the main repository."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if Plans directory would be created inside a worktree
PLANS_DIR_PARENT=$(dirname "$TENDRIL_HOME")
cd "$PLANS_DIR_PARENT"
if git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null && [ -f "$PLANS_DIR_PARENT/.git" ]; then
    if grep -q "gitdir:" "$PLANS_DIR_PARENT/.git"; then
        echo "ERROR: TENDRIL_HOME ($TENDRIL_HOME) is inside a git worktree."
        echo "Plans and their worktrees cannot be created inside worktrees."
        echo "Move your Tendril installation outside the worktree or use a different Plans directory."
        tendril job fail TendrilJobId --message="Cannot create worktrees: TENDRIL_HOME ($TENDRIL_HOME) is inside a git worktree. Move the Tendril installation or Plans directory outside the worktree."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

This prevents recursive worktree scenarios that would corrupt git state and cause massive repo bloat.

### 1.7. Validate Code State

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Validating code state..."`

After reading the plan revision, scan it for code validation markers to detect stale plans (where the described code has already been changed by another plan).

1. **Extract validation blocks** — Parse the plan revision for sections containing:
   - Headers matching `**Current implementation**`, `**Current implementation in <file>**`, or `**Old implementation**`
   - Fenced code blocks (` ```language ... ``` `) immediately following these headers
   - Associated file paths (markdown links with `file:///` or inline text like `helpers.py:217`)

2. **Validate code exists** — For each validation block found:
   - Extract the file path from the context (header text or preceding paragraph)
   - Convert `file:///` URLs to local paths if needed
   - If a line range is specified (e.g., `:217-242`), read those specific lines
   - Otherwise, read the entire file and search for the code snippet (normalize whitespace when comparing — ignore leading/trailing blank lines and trailing spaces)
   - **Exact match** → validation passes, proceed
   - **Not found** → validation fails, the code may have already changed
   - **File not found** → validation fails, the file may have been deleted/moved

3. **Decision logic:**
   - **If no validation blocks found** → Skip validation, proceed to worktree creation (backward compatible)
   - **If all validation blocks pass** → Proceed to worktree creation
   - **If any validation fails** → Stop here and fail the job. "Fail the plan" is a concrete
     three-step contract, not a state change:
     1. Write `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Verification/PreExecution.md` with `result: Fail` and the detailed
        per-block report below.
     2. Call `tendril job fail TendrilJobId --message="PreExecution failed: <reason>"`.
     3. `exit 1`.

     The server reads that report and routes the plan to `Failed` on its own, so do **not** set the
     state yourself (see step 9). Do not proceed to worktree creation, do not run verifications, and
     do not commit anything: there is nothing to verify on an unmodified base branch.

4. **Write validation report** — Create `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Verification/PreExecution.md`:

```markdown
---
result: Pass
date: <CurrentTime>
---
# PreExecution

**Blocks Found:** <number>

## Validation Blocks

### Block 1: <file path>
- **Status:** Pass / Fail
- **Expected:** (first 5 lines of expected code)
- **Actual:** (first 5 lines of actual code, or "File not found")

## Recommendation (on failure)

- Review the plan against the current codebase
- Check if this work was already completed by another plan
- Update the plan via UpdatePlan or mark as Skipped
```

**Note:** This step runs against the original repo (before worktrees are created), since it validates whether the plan's assumptions about the codebase are still accurate.

5. **Self-flagged redundancy check** - In addition to code block validation, scan the plan revision for markers where the plan itself admits it is already done:
   - A `<details><summary>Still relevant?</summary>` block whose body starts with `No.`
   - Phrases like *"Already applied"*, *"This plan is redundant"*, *"This plan is superseded"*, or *"previously attempted ... was merged to main via PR #NNNN"* in the `## Problem` or `## Solution` sections.

   If any marker is found, verify the claim: run `gh pr view <cited PR> --json state,mergeCommit` (must be `MERGED`), confirm the cited commit is in `git log origin/<default-branch>`, and byte-compare the plan's proposed code against the current file contents. If all three checks pass, fail **without creating a worktree** (running verifications on unchanged code wastes the time budget and produces a 0-commit PR that CreatePr cannot process):

   1. Write `Verification/PreExecution.md` with `result: Fail` and the evidence for each of the three checks.
   2. Write `Artifacts/summary.md` documenting the no-op (explicitly explaining that the task was skipped or retired because the changes are already resolved, rather than presenting a completed implementation draft).
   3. Call `tendril job fail TendrilJobId --message="PreExecution failed: Task already resolved/redundant (<reason>)"` and `exit 1`.

   **Do not set the verifications to `Skipped`.** An earlier revision of this document told you to, and
   that is exactly how a never-executed plan reached `Review`: the server's state decision keys on
   verification rows, so blanket `Skipped` makes every row look complete and routes the plan to
   `Review`, where one click marks it `Completed` with zero commits. Leave the rows `Pending` and let
   the `PreExecution: Fail` report and the non-zero exit do the work.

### 2. Create Worktrees

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Creating worktrees..."` (or "worktree" if only one)

For each repo in `RepoConfigs` (this includes both the plan's repos AND any read-only build dependencies from the project config):

1. **PR-source check (decide which flow to use).** If the `SourceUrl` firmware header is a
   GitHub **pull request** URL (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>`) **and** it points
   at *this* worktree's repo, the worktree should be based on the PR's branch so the fix updates the
   original PR instead of opening a second one — use the **PR-override flow** below. Otherwise, use
   the **standard flow**. Determine this and derive the PR details up front:

```bash
cd <original-repo-path>

USE_PR_OVERRIDE=false
if [[ -n "$SOURCE_URL" && "$SOURCE_URL" =~ github\.com/([^/]+/[^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+) ]]; then
  PR_REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"; PR_NUMBER="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
  ORIGIN_REPO=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's#.*github\.com[:/]([^/]+/[^/]+?)(\.git)?$#\1#')
  if [[ "$PR_REPO" == "$ORIGIN_REPO" ]]; then
    PR_JSON=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$PR_REPO" --json headRefName,state,isCrossRepository 2>/dev/null)
    PR_STATE=$(echo "$PR_JSON" | jq -r '.state')
    PR_FORK=$(echo "$PR_JSON" | jq -r '.isCrossRepository')
    PR_HEAD=$(echo "$PR_JSON" | jq -r '.headRefName')
    if [[ "$PR_STATE" == "OPEN" && "$PR_FORK" == "false" && -n "$PR_HEAD" && "$PR_HEAD" != "null" ]]; then
      USE_PR_OVERRIDE=true
      tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Basing worktree on PR #$PR_NUMBER branch '$PR_HEAD' (will update the existing PR)."
    else
      tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="PR #$PR_NUMBER is not updatable (state=$PR_STATE, fork=$PR_FORK) — falling back to a new branch + new PR."
    fi
  fi
fi
```

2. **Standard flow (default, `USE_PR_OVERRIDE=false`) — use the `add-worktree` CLI command, never
   hand-roll git:**

```bash
tendril plan add-worktree <TendrilPlanId> <RepoPath> [--base <resolved-base-branch>]
```

Pass `--base` only if the `RepoConfigs` firmware header sets a `baseBranch` for this repo; omit it
to let the command auto-detect the default branch. This single command replaces the entire manual
`git fetch` / stale-worktree-removal / `git worktree add` sequence: it computes the
plan's branch name (the `PlanBranch` firmware header, from the configured naming template) and `Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>` path internally, removes
any stale worktree and branch from a prior execution before creating the new one, fetches `origin`,
resolves the base branch, and verifies the `.git` file exists afterward. **Do not hand-roll any of
these git steps yourself** — this is the exact failure class (e.g. a Windows locale bug in
`grep -P`-based branch-name derivation) this command was built to eliminate. Always branch from
`origin/<resolved-base-branch>`, never local HEAD — the command enforces this — so the resulting PR
only contains the plan's commits, not any unpushed local work.

**Always take the worktree path from the command's own output, never assume a depth.** The layout
varies by provisioning tool: nested (`Worktrees/<owner>/<repo>`) under some CLIs, flat
(`Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>`) under others. Later steps that operate on the worktree (build
dependency setup, implementation, commits) must use the path this command reported, not a
hardcoded guess.

If the command exits non-zero, its output already explains which step failed (missing repo path,
stale-worktree removal failure, fetch failure, or worktree-add failure). Print that output and call:

```bash
tendril job fail TendrilJobId --message="Worktree creation failed for <repo-folder-name>: <captured command output>"
exit 1
```

3. **PR-override flow (exception, `USE_PR_OVERRIDE=true`).** `add-worktree` cannot be used here: it
   always creates a fresh `PlanBranch` branch, whereas this case must reuse/reset the
   PR's own head branch (`$PR_HEAD`, derived in step 1) so commits land on the existing PR instead of
   force-cutting a new branch over its history. Hand-roll it:

```bash
# Clean up any stale worktree/branch from a prior execution first (add-worktree does this
# automatically for the standard flow, but this hand-rolled path must do it explicitly).
tendril plan remove-worktree <TendrilPlanId> <repo-folder-name>

git fetch origin "$PR_HEAD"
git worktree add "<TendrilPlanFolder>/Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>" -B "$PR_HEAD" "origin/$PR_HEAD"
```

**Note on stale directories:** If a stale worktree directory exists and you run `git -C <stale-dir>
status`, git silently walks up the parent chain and reports the state of the main repo — making it
look like the "worktree" is simply on `main`. Do not trust that output. Before assuming a prior
worktree is intact, verify with `git -C <main-repo> worktree list | grep <path>` or check that
`<worktree-path>/.git` exists.

After creating the worktree this way, **verify the `.git` file exists** and fail fast if it's missing:

```bash
if [ ! -f "<TendrilPlanFolder>/Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>/.git" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Worktree creation failed - .git file missing at <TendrilPlanFolder>/Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>/.git"
    echo "This indicates git worktree add did not fully initialize the worktree."
    tendril job fail TendrilJobId --message="Worktree creation failed for <repo-folder-name>: .git file missing after 'git worktree add' — the worktree was not fully initialized."
    exit 1
fi
cat "<TendrilPlanFolder>/Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>/.git"
```

(The standard flow's `add-worktree` command already performs this check internally — this manual
check is only needed after the hand-rolled PR-override flow.)

**Note on `RepoConfigs`:** The firmware header may include a `RepoConfigs` value injected by Tendril. It contains per-repo configuration:
```yaml
RepoConfigs: |
  - path: /home/user/repos/my-project
    baseBranch: main
  - path: /home/user/repos/shared-lib
    baseBranch: main
    readOnly: true
```
If `baseBranch` is present for a repo, pass it as `--base` to `add-worktree` (or use it as the base ref in the PR-override flow). If absent, let `add-worktree` auto-detect it.

**Read-only repos** (`readOnly: true`) are build dependencies — they need worktrees so that cross-repo project references resolve, but you must NOT make changes, commits, or PRs in them. Create their worktrees the same way (standard flow above), but skip them during implementation steps 3-5.

### 2.5. Setup Build Dependencies in Worktrees

**Note:** This section applies only when the project has build-time dependencies (e.g. frontend packages, generated code, pre-built artifacts) that need special handling in worktrees. Skip if not applicable.

If this step applies, report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Setting up build dependencies..."`

Worktrees start with a clean checkout and may be missing build artifacts (e.g. `dist/`, `node_modules/`, generated files) that exist in the original repo. Determine whether the plan modifies these areas:

#### Default Path (No Changes to Build-Dependent Code)

If the plan does **NOT** modify code in directories with build artifacts, follow the rules below in
order. This repo's `node_modules` is ~1.2 GB across ~1373 `.pnpm` entries and `target/` is ~15 GB. A
recursive copy of either is the most common cause of an ExecutePlan job exceeding its tool timeout.
Obey every rule below.

1. **Scope the copy and the build.** A plan that changes no build-dependent code needs neither
   sibling worktrees nor a whole-workspace build. Scope both the copy and the build to what the plan
   actually touches. This rule outranks the others below: if scoping says no copy is needed, skip
   rules 2-4 entirely.
   - prompt / markdown / docs only → nothing to copy and nothing to pre-build
   - one pnpm workspace package → `pnpm --filter <pkg> build`, never `pnpm -r`
   - one crate → `cargo build -p <crate>`, never `--workspace`

2. **Clone artifacts copy-on-write.** Drive the copy off the worktree path reported by
   `add-worktree` in step 2 — never assume the layout depth, since it varies (nested
   `Worktrees/<owner>/<repo>` under some provisioning CLIs, flat `Worktrees/<repo-folder-name>`
   under others):

```bash
# $WORKTREE is the path reported by `tendril plan add-worktree` (step 2).
clone_dir() {  # clone_dir <src> <dest-parent>
  mkdir -p "$2"
  if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]] && cp -c -R "$1" "$2/" 2>/dev/null; then
    :                                          # APFS clonefile
  elif cp -r --reflink=auto "$1" "$2/" 2>/dev/null; then
    :                                          # btrfs / XFS reflink
  else
    cp -r "$1" "$2/"                           # last resort: a real deep copy
  fi
}
```

   Copy-on-write only works **within one filesystem**. `TendrilHome` and the repos are normally on
   the same volume, but a cross-volume clone falls back to a full byte copy silently — so the size
   rules below still apply even on a copy-on-write-capable filesystem.

3. **Never deep-copy `node_modules`.** pnpm stores every package once in a global
   content-addressable store (`~/Library/pnpm/store/v<N>` on macOS, printed by `pnpm store path`).
   Each `node_modules/<pkg>` is a symlink into `node_modules/.pnpm/<pkg>@<ver>/node_modules/<pkg>`,
   whose files are hardlinks into that store. A recursive copy breaks every hardlink, turning shared
   bytes into real bytes plus a fresh inode per file — orders of magnitude slower than re-linking.
   - **Preferred: re-link from the store in the worktree.** Run the project's install command (e.g.
     `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, or whatever the build verifications already call for). This
     relinks from the already-populated global store, moving metadata rather than package bytes.
     The store is global and shared by default, so the correct action is to install, not to copy.
   - Never redirect the package manager's store to a worktree-local path — that defeats the sharing
     and forces a real download.
   - If you must reuse the existing tree instead of installing, **symlink** each `node_modules`
     directory into the worktree rather than copying it. This does not conflict with the alias
     prohibition in the **Rules** section at the end of this document: that forbids aliases
     *pointing at* a worktree, whereas this is a link inside a worktree pointing at a main-repo
     directory.
   - If a copy is genuinely unavoidable, split it **per directory** so each command finishes inside
     the tool timeout — never copy all `node_modules` directories in one command.
   - Keep worktree paths short: package-manager virtual-store path-length limits (e.g.
     `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `virtualStoreDirMaxLength`) apply on top of an already-deep
     `Worktrees/` root.

4. **Never deep-copy `target/` either.** Same failure, larger — a Rust `target/` directory can run
   into the tens of gigabytes.
   - Clone it with the `clone_dir` helper from rule 2 when copy-on-write is available. Registry
     dependencies fingerprint against stable paths (e.g. `~/.cargo`), so their artifacts survive the
     move; workspace crates rebuild. That is still most of the build saved.
   - If copy-on-write is unavailable, **do not copy it** — build cold in the worktree.
   - Do **not** point the build tool's shared-output-directory setting (e.g. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) at
     the main repo's build output. A build tool that takes an exclusive lock on that directory makes
     concurrent ExecutePlan jobs serialize behind one another, and a blocked build is
     indistinguishable from a hung one.

5. **Skip dependency installation only when the scoped, cloned artifacts are sufficient.** This does
   not override a verification's own install step (e.g. `NpmBuild` running `pnpm install` itself) —
   it means don't redundantly reinstall on top of artifacts you already have.

#### Exception Path (Build-Dependent Code Changes)

If the plan **modifies** build-dependent code, you MUST rebuild:

1. **Install dependencies** using the project's package manager
2. **Run the build** to regenerate artifacts
3. If dependency installation fails after 2 attempts, document the failure and fail the plan

### 3. Handle Cross-Repo References

Projects may reference other repos via absolute paths in project files (e.g. build files, module manifests, package configs).

These paths point to the original repos, not the worktree copies. Since we only modify files in the worktree, this is usually fine — the build references the original (stable) code.

**Do NOT modify project reference paths.** If a build fails because of cross-repo references, work around it by building from the worktree directory which inherits the original's references.

### 4. Implement

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Implementing: <plan title>"`

Work exclusively in the worktree directories. Follow the plan's latest revision:

1. **Problem** - Understand what needs to be done
2. **Solution** - Execute the implementation steps in the worktree
3. **Tests** - Write and run all tests specified in the plan
   - **Loopback only for servers:** When writing tests, demo apps, or mock servers that listen on a port, always bind to loopback (127.0.0.1 or ::1) instead of 0.0.0.0. Binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) is blocked and triggers "listen EPERM" errors on some systems.

**Status cadence:** During implementation, if any sub-task takes longer than 90 seconds, issue an intermediate status update describing the current activity (e.g., `"Implementing: writing tests..."`, `"Implementing: fixing lint errors..."`, `"Implementing: reading reference code..."`). The user should never see the same status message for more than ~90 seconds.

### 5. Commit

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Committing changes..."`

Make logically grouped commits in the worktree(s). Each commit should be a coherent unit of work.

Before each commit, run formatting/linting as defined by the project's verifications. Fetch the full prompt for a verification with `tendril verification get <name>`.

**Example patterns** (actual commands come from verification prompts):

```bash
# Get changed files from this execution's commits
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACM HEAD~1)

# Run your formatter on changed files (examples):
# - .NET: dotnet format --include <files>
# - JavaScript: npm run format <files>
# - Python: black <files>
# - Go: gofmt -w <files>
```

If your formatter requires a workspace/solution file that isn't in the current directory, pass it as an explicit argument. Check `Memory/` for repo-specific workspace paths.

Commit messages should be clear and descriptive:

```
Add settings app with config display
```

After all commits, verify no uncommitted files remain:

```bash
git status
```

If there are uncommitted changes, either commit them or discard them with a clear reason. The worktree must be clean.

### 6. Document Commits

Use the CLI to record commits, verifications, and related plans — **never edit plan.yaml directly**.

Add each commit hash:

```bash
tendril plan add-commit <plan-id> abc1234
tendril plan add-commit <plan-id> def5678
```

Verification statuses are already set in `plan.yaml` (seeded at plan creation, optionally adjusted by the user in the UI). Do **not** derive them from the plan revision — there is no `## Verification` section anymore. You only update each verification's status to `Pass`/`Fail` after running it (Step 7).

If the plan references other plans (e.g. split-from, follow-up), add them via CLI.

**CRITICAL:** The `tendril plan add-commit` and `tendril plan set-verification` CLI commands are the ONLY mechanism that updates plan.yaml. If you skip them, the plan will be marked as Failed even if all verifications pass. You MUST call these commands — do not assume writing verification report files is sufficient.

### 7. Run Verifications

Create a `Verification/` directory in the plan folder if it doesn't exist.

Get the run-set via `tendril plan verification list <plan-id> --json` — it emits a JSON array of `{ name, status }` **in run order**. Run the entries whose `status` is `Pending`, in array order. Skip entries whose `status` is `Skipped`.

**Delegated verifications:** Some verifications are implemented as separate promptwares (e.g., `IvyFrameworkVerification`). The **Projects** section marks delegated verifications. Delegated verifications MUST be run via `tendril promptware run <Name>` — you are FORBIDDEN from writing their report files or setting their status to Pass yourself. If the `tendril` CLI is unavailable and you cannot invoke the sub-promptware, you MUST set the verification to `Fail` with a report explaining the CLI failure. Never self-certify a delegated verification.

**IMPORTANT — delegated invocation syntax:** The `tendril promptware run` CLI takes the plan folder as a **positional argument** (NOT a named flag like `--plan-folder`). You MUST also pass `--value` flags for each required firmware value. The exact command is in the verification's prompt (fetched via `tendril verification get <Name>`) — copy it character-for-character, only replacing angle-bracketed placeholders with actual paths. If the command is wrong, the child promptware receives no arguments and silently fails.

**Run every verification synchronously.** Never spawn a verification as a background task and poll it. A turn that ends while a background task is still running fails the job outright, and a polled verification can be recorded `Pass` while its tests are still running. If a verification does not fit one tool call, narrow its scope per the plan's **Tests** section — do not background it.

For each `Pending` verification (in listed order):

1. Send a status message: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Verifying: <Name>"`
2. Fetch its full prompt: `tendril verification get <Name>`
3. **Check if delegated:** The **Projects** section indicates which verifications are delegated — follow the prompt's instructions to invoke it as an external process. If the external process cannot be invoked (CLI broken, file lock, etc.), set the verification to `Fail` immediately. Do NOT attempt to do the verification inline or write the report yourself.
4. Execute the prompt in the worktree directory
5. If it fails: diagnose, fix the issue, **commit the fix** (e.g. `Fix lint errors from Build`), and re-run. Repeat until it passes (fail the plan after 3+ failed attempts).
6. Document all fix commits via CLI: `tendril plan add-commit <plan-id> <sha>`
7. Update the verification status via CLI: `tendril plan set-verification <plan-id> <Name> Pass` (or `Fail`)

**CRITICAL:** You MUST call `tendril plan set-verification` after EACH verification. The verification report file alone is NOT sufficient — plan.yaml must also be updated via the CLI. Failing to call this command will result in the plan being marked as Failed.

**!IMPORTANT: Every verification MUST produce a report** at `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Verification/<VerificationName>.md` using YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
result: Pass
date: <CurrentTime>
attempts: <number>
---
# <VerificationName>

## Output

<command output or summary>

## Fixes Applied

<list of fix commits made during this verification, or "None">

## Issues Found

<any remaining issues, or "None">
```

The `result` field in the frontmatter MUST be one of: `Pass`, `Fail`, or `Skipped`. A verification is not complete without both its report file AND the `tendril plan set-verification` CLI call.

### 7.4. Record Evidence (user-facing changes)

If this plan changes anything a person sees or does (a page, a screen, a form, a flow, a visible API response), prove it works by showing it. "The tests passed" is not what a reviewer wants to see for UI work.

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Recording evidence..."`

1. **Run the real thing** in the worktree: start the app or service the way the project's README or `AGENTS.md` says, with fake or seed data if it needs any.
2. **Drive it like a user** and capture what you did. Use whatever the repository already has for browser automation (Playwright is common: `page.screenshot(...)`, and `recordVideo` in the browser context for a clip). If the repository has none, use the simplest tool available on the machine. Do not add a dependency to the project just for evidence.
3. **Capture, at least:** one screenshot of each state the plan changed or added, and, for a multi-step flow (login, then trade, then confirmation), one short recording of the whole flow. Keep clips under about 30 seconds and files under 40 MB.
4. **Attach each file**, with a caption saying what it shows and the step you were on:

   ```bash
   tendril evidence add <file> --plan <plan-id> --caption "The order ticket after a market buy" --step "Placed a trade"
   ```

   It copies the file into the plan's `Artifacts`; delete your scratch copies afterwards. List what is attached with `tendril evidence list --plan <plan-id>`.
5. **Be honest about gaps.** If you could not run it (a missing service, no display, no credentials), do not skip this silently: say in the summary exactly what you could not capture and why. A change with nothing but a gap note is judged accordingly.
6. **Changes with nothing to see** (an internal refactor, a dependency bump, tests only) need no evidence: write `N/A` in the summary's Evidence section.

### 7.5. Generate Summary

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Generating summary..."`

After all verifications pass, create `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Artifacts/summary.md` summarizing what was done. Because this runs after verification, the summary reflects the final state of the code — including any fix commits made during Step 7.

The summary should follow this structure:

~~~markdown
# Summary

## Changes

<Brief description of what was implemented — 2-3 sentences max>

## API Changes

<List any new/changed/removed public APIs: classes, methods, properties, endpoints, CLI commands, config keys. Use code formatting. If no API changes, write "None.">

## Files Modified

<Bulleted list of key files changed, grouped by category. Don't list every file — focus on the important ones.>

## Evidence

<What you attached with `tendril evidence add` and what each shows, or what you could not capture and why, or "N/A — nothing user-facing.">

## Manual Testing

<Step-by-step instructions for a human reviewer to verify this change works correctly. Include:
- What to launch/open (e.g., "Run the app", "Open the Plans view")
- What action to perform (e.g., "Click the Execute button on a plan with dependencies")
- What to observe (e.g., "The plan should show 'Blocked' status instead of executing")

If the change has no observable user-facing behavior (e.g., internal refactor, dependency update, code cleanup), write "N/A — internal change with no user-facing behavior.">
~~~

Focus on **what changed** (past tense), not what the plan said to do. Emphasize API surface changes — new classes, renamed methods, added properties, changed signatures — since these affect consumers.

### 7.6. Generate Recommendations

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Generating recommendations..."`

After all verifications pass, reflect on what you observed during this plan's execution. Write down anything you noticed that isn't part of this plan's scope:

- Follow-up work, edge cases not covered, or related features
- Confusing code, inconsistent patterns, or technical debt in the files you touched or read
- Unrelated bugs, broken tests, or incorrect behavior in surrounding code
- Performance improvements, unnecessary complexity, or refactoring opportunities

For each item, register it via the CLI:

```bash
tendril plan rec add <plan-id> "Short descriptive title" -d "Markdown description with context and location." --impact=Medium
```

`--impact` is optional (Small, Medium, or High) and indicates the value of implementing it.

The description is rendered as markdown in the Recommendations app and the Review tab, so write it
as displayable markdown, not a bare sentence:

- Use short paragraphs, bullets, and fenced code blocks for snippets.
- Link every file the reader needs with a markdown link whose URL is an absolute `file:///` path
  written with forward slashes. Put the line number in the display text only, never in the URL (no
  `:42` suffix, no `#L123`) — see the plan link rules in the Reference Documents.
- Only link files that exist; write paths of files that do not exist yet in inline code instead.
- Reference other plans as bare `Plan NNNNN` in prose and let the link polisher convert them.

Do NOT include items that are part of the current plan's scope. Do NOT include recommendations about code formatting, linting, or style issues — those are handled by verifications.

**After registering any recommendations via the CLI**, create `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Artifacts/recommendations.md`. Having zero recommendations is fine — but the file must still be created:

~~~markdown
# Recommendations

## Items

- **<Title>** — <one-line summary>
- **<Title>** — <one-line summary>

*Or: "None — <one sentence explaining why>"*
~~~

**This file is mandatory.** Step 8 will verify it exists and fail the plan if it is missing.

### 8. Final Clean Check

Report status: `tendril job status TendrilJobId --message="Running final checks..."`

After all verifications pass:

1. Kill any remaining processes spawned during plan execution (e.g. dev servers, sample apps). Find processes whose working directory or binary path is under the plan folder's artifacts directory and terminate them.

2. Clean up any temporary files created in Step 2.5 (e.g. generated config files, auth tokens).

3. Run `git status` in every worktree. If there are any uncommitted files (from verification fixes, generated files, etc.), commit or discard them. The worktrees must be completely clean before finishing.

4. Verify `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Artifacts/recommendations.md` exists. If missing, go back to Step 7.6.

5. Verify `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Artifacts/summary.md` exists. If missing, go back to Step 7.5.

### 8.5. Worktree Lifecycle

Do **not** clean up worktrees in ExecutePlan. Leave them on disk so that CreatePr can push branches and create PRs directly from the worktree.

Cleanup is handled elsewhere — by CreatePr after PRs are created/merged, and by the background `WorktreeCleanupService` (which retains a failed plan's worktree for later inspection, so failure is not a reason to remove it).

### 9. Plan State

**🚫 FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT call `tendril plan set <plan-id> state <anything>`. The Tendril server handles all state transitions automatically based on your exit code and verification statuses. Setting state manually causes the plan to appear in Review prematurely while your job is still running.

A failed pre-execution (step 1.7) is signalled by `Verification/PreExecution.md` with `result: Fail`, plus `tendril job fail` and a non-zero exit, never by writing `state`. The server reads that report and routes the plan to `Failed`.

### Ambiguity Handling

You are running in non-interactive mode and CANNOT ask questions. If you are unsure about requirements, encounter conflicting instructions, or cannot find referenced files — STOP and fail with a clear message explaining what needs clarification. Do NOT guess when uncertain.

**Unanswered question blocks.** Before doing any work, scan the plan revision you read  in step 1 for any fenced `questions` block (see the **Question Blocks** section of **Reference Documents**).

An unanswered question is **not** a failure. The user saw the block and chose not to answer, which is a decision in itself: it means *you* decide. Resolve each one yourself, in this order:

1. **Take the `recommended` option** if the question has one. It is the asking agent's own choice, made with the plan in front of it.
2. **Otherwise pick the most reasonable answer** from the options, or — for a free-text question — from the plan and the code. Prefer the option that is smallest in scope and easiest to change later.

Record every question you resolved this way in the execution log with the answer you picked and the one-line reason, so the decision is auditable and the next revision can fold it in. Then continue.

A question that already carries an `answer` is a decision the user made: honor it exactly, and never re-decide it. A block that is fully answered but still present — the user executed without running UpdatePlan first — is likewise not a failure. ExecutePlan never writes revisions, so it never adds or edits question blocks.

### Rules

- All work happens in worktree directories, never in the original repos
- **Wireframes are a layout reference, never code.** A `wireframe` block in the plan points at `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Wireframes/<name>/`. Read its `src/` files, or screenshot it with `tendril wireframe screenshot`, to understand the intended layout, then build the screen with the project's own UI stack and components. Never copy a wireframe's files, components or markup into a worktree, never add `tendril-wireframes` to a project, and never edit the wireframe. Tendril checks the plan's changes and fails the plan if wireframe code is in them; `tendril plan check-wireframes <plan-id>` shows what it finds.
- Make logically grouped commits — not one giant commit
- Worktrees must be clean (no uncommitted files) when finished
- Document all commit hashes via `tendril plan add-commit` — never edit plan.yaml directly
- Follow the plan instructions exactly as written
- Do NOT skip tests or pre-commit formatting
- Commit messages must reference the plan ID
- Convert `file:///` paths in plans to local filesystem paths appropriate for your OS
- Do NOT commit artifact files (screenshots, images) to the repo. Test artifacts belong in `<TendrilPlanFolder>/Artifacts/` only — CreatePr handles uploading them to persistent storage.
- If the project uses private package registries, ensure authentication is configured before running dependency installation in worktrees. Credentials should come from environment variables or project-level configuration.
- Do NOT create filesystem aliases or shortcuts (e.g. symlinks, drive mappings) to worktree paths. The plans directory path is managed by Tendril — additional indirection causes cleanup issues.
