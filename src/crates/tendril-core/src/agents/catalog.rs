//! The agent / model / effort catalog the UI populates its picker from.
//!
//! This is a port of V1's catalogue, whose authority is spread over three places:
//!
//! * `AgentServiceCollectionExtensions.AddAgentInfrastructure` registers the providers, and
//!   `IAgentRunner.RegisteredAgents` hands that registration order straight to the picker — which is
//!   why [`AGENTS`] below is ordered antigravity, claude, codex, copilot, gemini, opencode, ivy,
//!   openaiproxy rather than alphabetically or by popularity.
//! * each provider's `GetStaticModels()` declares the models that provider offers **and the effort
//!   ladder each of those models carries**. The ladder is therefore a property of the (agent, model)
//!   pair, not of the agent: Copilot on `claude-opus-5` offers Claude's five levels, and on `gpt-5.4`
//!   its own four. `ChatApp.GetEffortsForAgentAndModel` resolves it — model row first, agent
//!   descriptor second — and [`efforts_for`] is that function.
//! * `Abstractions/ModelCatalog.EffortLevels` declares the ladders themselves.
//!
//! # Why the model set is declared rather than derived
//!
//! An earlier V2 built each agent's list by filtering one shared spec table
//! ([`crate::agents::model_specs`]) on an id prefix — `claude-*` for Claude, `gemini-*` for Gemini —
//! on the theory that the ids the picker offers and the ids that carry pricing could then never
//! drift. That inverts V1: `CachedModelCatalogProvider.GetModelsAsync` takes the provider's own
//! `GetStaticModels()` as the row set and lets models.dev **enrich the prices of those rows only**;
//! models.dev never adds a row.
//!
//! Deriving the rows instead made provenance a property of the id *string*, which is not provenance
//! at all:
//!
//! * `register_dynamic_specs` loads all of models.dev — some 15,000 rows across a hundred providers
//!   — into the shared table, so every Bedrock, Vertex and OpenRouter spelling of a model
//!   (`claude-opus-5@eu`, `claude-4.5-sonnet`, `moonshotai/kimi-k3-free`) landed in the picker of
//!   whichever agent's prefix it happened to match. Claude's list went from 18 rows to 83, most of
//!   them ids the Claude CLI cannot launch.
//! * a row whose id matched no prefix was offered by any agent whose filter was `Any` — which the
//!   proxy pointed at an unrecognised base URL was, so it offered every model in existence,
//!   including every Gemini, where V1 offers a declared union of five catalogues.
//!
//! So the row set is declared here, one list per provider, exactly as V1 declares it
//! ([`CLAUDE_MODELS`] and friends are `ClaudeModelCatalog.GetStaticModels()` and friends), and
//! `model_specs` is left to do the one job V1 gives it: price a model once one is chosen. The
//! no-drift promise is kept by a test instead of by construction —
//! `every_declared_model_carries_a_pricing_spec` asserts every id here resolves through
//! `model_specs::find`.
//!
//! # The default model is a real model
//!
//! V1 has no synthetic `default` row. One row per catalogue carries `ModelInfo.IsDefault`,
//! `ModelCatalogSorter.Sort(preserveDefault: true)` pins that row **first**, and
//! `ChatApp.ResolveModel` resolves "the default" to that row's real id. So V1's picker lists real
//! models, the first of them is the default, and nothing in the UI ever says `default`.
//!
//! V2 used to prepend a fake `default` row to every list instead, which put an id in the picker that
//! named no model and meant something different in each arm of the launcher. [`AgentDef::default_model`]
//! is V1's flag, [`build_agent`] pins it first, and [`default_model_for`] is `ResolveModel`.
//!
//! `default` survives in exactly two places, both of them V1's:
//!
//! * **as an effort**, where V1 really does offer a "Default" option and normalises it to `""` on save
//!   (`CodingAgentSetupView.SetProfile`), and
//! * **as a config value for a profile's model**, where it is how `config.yaml` spells "no opinion" —
//!   `resolution::is_set` reads it as unset and the launcher then passes no `--model` at all. Configs
//!   already hold it, so it keeps that meaning; it is simply no longer offered as something to choose.
//!
//! One thing is deliberately not V1: **retired ids**. V1 still declares `claude-fable-5` and
//! `claude-5.1`, which no longer resolve; V2 declares `claude-fable-5-1` in their place and does not
//! resurrect the dead ones.
