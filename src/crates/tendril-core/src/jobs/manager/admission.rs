//! Starting a job: the gates it must pass and the row it leaves behind.
//!
//! [`JobManager::start_job_with`] is the only way a job comes into existence. It runs the
//! idempotency-key lookup, the conflict check, the duplicate-work check, the plan dependency gate
//! and the wait-for-jobs gate, then allocates an id and inserts the job — the first four under the
//! `start_lock`, so check-then-insert is indivisible. The priority and chat-session resolvers live
//! here because nothing else calls them.
