/// the agent against the operator's main checkout, so a creation failure is fatal to the job — which
/// is also what the promptware does when `tendril plan add-worktree` exits non-zero.

/// Only `plan.repos` are covered here. Read-only build dependencies reach the same `add_worktree`
/// through the CLI, driven by the promptware's `RepoConfigs` loop.
