//! Moving a plan through its states as the jobs that name it run.
//!
//! Each job type claims a plan into an in-flight state on launch and settles it on exit, and every

//! holds no matter which path got here. [`sync_plan_state_to_db`] is the mirror: `plan.yaml` is the
//! record, but the plan list and the Kanban columns read SQLite.
