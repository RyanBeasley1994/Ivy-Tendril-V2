//! `/api/projects` — the project registry the app and CLI both drive.
//!
//! One module per sub-resource, mirroring the route tree this crate's router builds: `crud` for the
//! project record, then `repos`, `verifications`, `review_actions` and `hooks` for the
//! collections hanging off it. `payloads` holds the request bodies, which are shared across
//! several of those, and `cloning` the remote-URL-to-local-clone pass that create and update and
//! add-repo all need.
//!
//! Every handler is re-exported here so the router keeps naming them `projects::<handler>`.
