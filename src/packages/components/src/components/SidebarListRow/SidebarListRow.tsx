/**
 * V1 `Helpers/SidebarListRow.cs` in three forms, as one shared component rather than one copy per
 * sidebar.
 *
 * V1 builds every row through the private `BuildButton`: full width, `Secondary` while selected and
 * `Ghost` otherwise. Rounding follows V1's own rule - the plain overloads sit inside a `List` widget
 * between its straight separator lines and stay square, while the icon overload lives in gap-spaced
 * menus and keeps its rounding.
 *
 * Two V2 sidebars had reimplemented this markup independently - the Settings nested sidebar
 * (`Apps/Settings/SettingsApp.cs`) and `InboxView`'s category rail - and had already drifted, so this
 * is the union of the two, and both are now thin delegations to it. The Shell's own primary sidebar
 * renders its own `.tsh-nav-item`/`.tsh-rail-item`/`.tsh-section-item` markup rather than this
 * component; `Shell/SidebarListRow.tsx` only re-exports it so `Shell/index.ts` keeps working. It
 * lives outside `Shell/` because its two real consumers are app views, not shell chrome.

 * What makes a row read as a control. Applied only on the branches that render a `<button>`, never
 * on the static sub-item -- `cursor-pointer` and `cursor-default` are the same specificity and
 * Tailwind emits `.cursor-pointer` *after* `.cursor-default` in its utility order, so a base-level
 * `cursor-pointer` would silently win over the static row's own `cursor-default`.
 *
 * `cursor-pointer` has to be stated because nothing grants it any more: Tailwind v3's preflight
 * shipped `button, [role="button"] { cursor: pointer }` and v4 -- 4.1.16 here -- dropped that rule,
 * so every `<button>` in this repo gets the default `cursor: auto` unless its own classes say
 * otherwise. `buttonVariant` in `ui/button/variant.ts` compensates explicitly; these rows never did,
 * which is why a Settings sidebar row reads as inert text under the pointer.
 *
 * The focus ring is the same omission seen from the keyboard: the rows are real `<button>`s and were
 * always reachable by Tab, but with no ring nothing showed where focus was. `ring-inset` because a
 * rail row spans the full sidebar width, so an outset ring would be clipped by the container edge.

 * the *selected* row already uses, so hovering previews the selected state at 60%: 1.14:1 light and

 * respond to -- a false affordance is the same bug as a missing one. It was previously ungated and
 * got away with it only because `bg-accent` was invisible. `disabled:hover:bg-transparent` is the
 * same rule for the other inert case: `SidebarListRow` takes a `disabled` prop, and a disabled row
 * that still fills on hover would contradict the `not-allowed` cursor it shows at the same moment.
 * `disabled:text-muted-foreground` is unconditional rather than hover-gated, since a disabled row
