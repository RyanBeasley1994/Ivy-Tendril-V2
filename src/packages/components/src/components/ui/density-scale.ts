/**
 * The framework's `Responsive<Density?>`, as a hook.
 *
 * Ivy widgets take a density per breakpoint — V1's Jobs table is
 * `.Density(new Responsive<Density?> { Default = Density.Large, Desktop = Density.Medium })`
 * (`Apps/Jobs/JobsApp.DataTable.cs:40`): roomier where a finger is the pointer, tighter where a mouse is.
 * V2's `DensityProvider` carries one density and has no notion of a breakpoint, so this is the missing
 * half — a subscription to one media query, resolved to one of two densities.
 *
 * `query` defaults to Tailwind's `lg` (1024px), which is the breakpoint every other responsive rule in
 * these packages uses; passing a different one is how a caller expresses a different `Responsive` map.
 *
 * Outside a browser — a test, a server render — there is no `matchMedia`, and `desktop` is the honest
 * answer for a desktop shell rather than a layout nobody is looking at on a phone.
